# HCP_cluster_analysis

All analysis is performed in Matlab (2017a) unless otherwise noted. 

Neuroimaging data were extracted from HCP S90 release, placed in specific folders and organization on my drive. 

Data can be extracted by running:
hcp_clus_initialize.m 
(loads data from tmaps into matlab structure, see file for details)

Cognitive data of interest was placed into a CSV file (Extracted from unrestricted_chawco_9_14_2017_11_40_10.csv, not made available)
